1.6.29,UNT,Explanation,Where are variables declared in a C plus plus program?,It depends if variable is global then one has to declare variables outside the source code to be used in every scope . However a local variable is one that one declares in a local function . Obviously one does not need to declare it outside the variable seeing how one uses it for the function or block it is being called for .,One can declare variables anywhere in a program . One can declare them inside a function ( local variables ) or outside the functions ( global variables ) ., 
2.2.5,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?,One cannot access a local variable outside the function in which it is declared .

One can only access local variables inside the member function that defines them ., 
2.2.14,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?,A data member is a more general term describing all objects instantiated within a member function .

One can only access local variables inside the member function that defines them .,One can access data members from any member functions inside the class defintion . One can only access local variables inside the member function that defines them
2.2.15,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?,A data member exists permanently in the program's memory as long as the program is run .

1.6.14,UNT,Explanation,Where are variables declared in a C plus plus program?,One can declare global variables in the body of the code . One declares local variables in the function they are to be used ( unless the function is being passed a variable ) . One should always declare variables before use .,One can declare variables anywhere in a program . One can declare them inside a function ( local variables ) or outside the functions ( global variables ) ., 
1.6.16,UNT,Explanation,Where are variables declared in a C plus plus program?,In the main function,One can declare variables anywhere in a program .

One can declare them inside a function ( local variables ) or outside the functions ( global variables ) .,One can declare variables inside a function ( local variables ) or outside the functions ( global variables )
2.2.3,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?,One declares data members inside the class,One can access data members from any member functions inside the class defintion . One can only access local variables inside the member function that defines them .,One can access local variables only inside the member function that defines them
2.2.4,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?,Data members are variables that represent an attribute in a class definition . One cannot use local variables Local variables declared in a function body cannot be used outside of that function body . When a function terminates the values of its local variables are lost .,One can access data members from any member functions inside the class defintion . One can only access local variables inside the member function that defines them .,One can access data members from any member functions inside the class defintion
2.2.6,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?,A data member is part of a C plus plus class or structure that stores data of a certain type . A local variable inside a member function is only available inside that function,One can access data members from any member functions inside the class defintion . One can only access local variables inside the member function that defines them .,One can access data members from any member functions inside the class defintion
2.2.8,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a data member and a local variable inside a member function?,Data members are the attributes of the function and one can use them outside the function .

2.6.2,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?,The FUNCTION PROTOTYPE is where the programmer declares that he or she is using a function other than main ( ) . This is like declaring a variable . The programmer knows that he or she will be using in the future,A function prototype includes the function signature,"A function prototype includes the return type, and the parameters's type"
2.6.14,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?,A function prototype lays out the name,A function prototype includes the function signature, 
2.6.15,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?,A function definition is the code that defines the function placed in the brackets that determines that function 's operation . A function prototype shows the function's public interface without exposing implementation . It shows name,A function prototype includes the function signature, 
2.6.16,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?,A function prototype is just a declaration of the function existing . One cannot use it as an actual function . One has to create a function with a definition within to tell the compiler what the function does .,A function prototype includes the function signature,The function definition includes the actual body of the function
2.6.17,UNT,Explanation,What is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?,The Prototype creates a framework to call the function definition . While a function definition is where one actually programmes out the function and creates it into a final product .,A function prototype includes the function signature, 
4.4.1,UNT,Explanation,"What is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?",A static array will store the new values that one assigned them to each of its elements. Meaning if one calls a function twice it will use the last values that were returned the first time. If one does not declare it static then the new values will not be stored and will be reset to their original value.,The arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program . One can initialize them only once, 
4.4.16,UNT,Explanation,"What is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?",A static local array exists for the duration of the program and one can initialize its elements to 0 if one did not explicitly initialize it. So a static local array's elements will still be the same when called later unless one specifically initialized it to something else. This does not happen for automatic arrays.,The arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program . One can initialize them only once, 
4.4.21,UNT,Explanation,"What is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?",When one declares array static the array is not destroyed after the function is over. When one does not declare an array as static,The arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program . One can initialize them only once, 
4.4.26,UNT,Explanation,"What is the difference between an array declared as static, and one that is not?",One can use only constants to declare the size of automatic and static arrays. Static array exists for the duration of the program. One can initialize it when one first encounters its declaration. One can initialize all elements to zero if one does not explicitly initialize them.,The arrays declared as static live throughout the life of the program . One can initialize them only once,
